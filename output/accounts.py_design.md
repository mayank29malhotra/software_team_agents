The above design and implementation provide a comprehensive solution for the account management system. The `Account` class encapsulates the functionality for managing user accounts, and the `get_share_price` function provides a test implementation for retrieving share prices. The error handling mechanisms ensure that the system raises exceptions for invalid operations, such as insufficient funds or unknown share symbols. The test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
